# Session Notes – Session Memory (SM)

> Rolling log of what happened in each focused work session.  
> Append-only. Do not delete past sessions.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Latest Summary (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Rehydrated context from `spec.md` into PROJECT_CONTEXT/NOW/INVARIANTS for the Bot-Likelihood Analyzer.
- Updated SESSION_NOTES to reflect the new scope and constraints.
- Next step is starting v0.1 implementation (collector, schema, scoring, API, UI).
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

---

## Maintenance Rules (reduce drift)

- Append-only entries; never rewrite history.
- Update this summary block every session with the last 1–3 sessions.
- Roll up stable decisions to PROJECT_CONTEXT and active tasks to NOW.
